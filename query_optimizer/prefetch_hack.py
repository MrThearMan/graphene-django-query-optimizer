    Patches the prefetch mechanism to not create duplicate joins in the SQL query.
    This is needed due to how filtering with many-to-many relations is implemented in Django,
    which creates new joins for consecutive filters for the same relation.
    See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#spanning-multi-valued-relationships

    For nested connection fields, a window function with a partition on the many-to-many field
    is used to limit the queryset. This adds an OUTER join for the through table of the many-to-many field.
    Then, when the prefetch queryset is filtered by `_filter_prefetch_queryset` to just the instances
    from the parent model, an INNER join is added to the through table. This creates unnecessary duplicates
    in the SQL query, which messes up the window function's partitioning. Therefore, this hack is needed
    to prevent the INNER join from being added.
